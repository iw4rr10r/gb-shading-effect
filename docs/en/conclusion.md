# The final word

We are coming to the end of this tutorial. I hope that you appreciated it and that you were able to retain the main points. Feel free to send me your comments, or to ask me for clarification on what you have not understood correctly, [on the official page of this Creation](https://gamebuino.com/creations/big-tuto-on-shading-effect-in-high-resolution).

> I would especially like to express my warmest thanks to Andy ([aoneill](https://gamebuino.com/@aoneill)) for his major contributions to the Gamebuino planet, and in particular the magic keys he gave to us to open the doors to high resolution in `RGB565`. It is now possible to do some very nice things on this small console, taking advantage of all its capabilities.

I would also like to thank [@minirop](https://gamebuino.com/@minirop) for his wise advice and sharp remarks about the notion of virtual destructor, as well as [@Jicehel](https://gamebuino.com/@jicehel) for his careful reading of the entire tutorial.

I would also like to thank the entire community that is active around Aurélien's project to promote it, to deliver its contributions in Open Source and to contribute to the building of a wonderful educational tool for our young budding coders, and for all of us finally, since each of us continues to learn in the light of the many creations on the [gamebuino.com](https://gamebuino.com) website.

Congratulations to Aurélien and the whole team for leading this project and creating this wonderful community.
